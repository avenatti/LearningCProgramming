# Learning C Programming
_I'm documenting my experience teaching myself the C programming language. Hopefully you can learn from experiences (good or bad) and optimize your own path. I will explain each resource, note the cost, time commitment, rating (scale from 1-10 where higher numbers are better), and the days I actually made progress.<br/><br/>
`The "/Examples" folder structure matches resource numbering below.`_

Lecture | Cost | Time | Rating | Day
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Title of Learning Resource | USD | Time Commitment | 1 to 10 (Higher is better) | The day that I studied the resource. This process starts on day 1.

**1.** **Build Malware Using C Language** | FREE | 2 hours | 7 | **Day 1** <br/>
We need to be inspired-->driven-->motivated in order to learn anything. I'm in cybersecurity so I found the following video leveraging C in my profession. Find an example applicable to your use case. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNARFYdN59w&list=PLDE9OqU7MZWxaSVBz_cLtaVBwrlEUr8TB.

**2.** **[Step By Step Guide] How to set up visual studio code for C and C++ programming 2021.** | FREE | 35 min | 9 | **Day 1** <br/>
We need an IDE, compiler, and intellisense to practice as we learn. This should be setup now! I favor visual studio code for most projects. It provides a very similiar user experience on Windows, MAC, and Linux. The following article will help you get setup with **VS Code** and the **MinGW** compiler. Conceptual steps are very similar for Linux. I may swap to Ubuntu for developemnt later. I normally use Ubuntu for machine learning related tasks...

_**Note:** Verify Compiler Installation: Windows Key + R. Run cmd. Type **g++ --version**._

**3.** **C Development Fundamentals** | $29/mo | 6.5 hours | (below) | **Day 1-3** <br/>
I was a developer for 10 years (C#.NET, js, SQL, python) but it has been 5 years since I've programmed daily. I'm very rusty. I want to embrace starting from the beginning. I'm using Pluralsight's self-paced video lectures: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/c-development-fundamentals.
