# Learning C Programming
_I'm documenting my experience teaching myself the C programming language. Hopefully you can learn from experiences (good or bad) and optimize your own path. I will explain each resource, note the cost, time commitment, rating (scale from 1-10 where higher numbers are better), and the days I actually made progress._
